# Size Epics by Sprint Count

## Overview

Set story points on LOG Epics based on the sum of child issue story
points. Child SP represent **days of work**. Epic SP represent **sprints of
work** (1 sprint = 3 weeks = 15 working days).

## Usage

```
/estimate-epic LOG-1234              # size one Epic
/estimate-epic LOG-1234 LOG-1235 # size multiple Epics
/estimate-epic                           # size ALL unsized open Epics
```

Also invoked automatically after creating a new Epic.

## Conversion

| Child SP (days) | Epic SP (sprints) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1–15            | 1                 |
| 16–30           | 2                 |
| 31–45           | 3                 |
| 46–60           | 4                 |
| 61–75           | 5                 |

**Formula:** `epic_sp = ceil(total_child_sp / 15)`

If the result exceeds 5, warn the user that the Epic should probably be split.

## Jira Field Reference

- **Story Points field:** `customfield_10028` (number, float — used on both Epics and child issues)
- **Project:** `LOG`
- **Epic Link field for JQL:** `"Epic Link"` or `parent`
- **Sprint duration:** 3 weeks (15 working days)
- **CLI tool**: `acli` (Atlassian CLI) — load `/jira:jira` skill for full command reference
- **Custom field writes**: `acli` does not support custom fields; use Jira REST API with `$JIRA_USER` and `$JIRA_TOKEN`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine target Epics

**If arguments provided:** Extract all `LOG-XXXX` keys from the arguments.

**If no arguments:** Query Jira for all unsized open Epics:

```bash
acli jira workitem search --jql 'project = LOG AND issuetype = Epic AND resolution = Unresolved AND "Story Points" is EMPTY' --json
```

### Step 2: For each Epic

#### 2a. Fetch child issues and their story points

Load the `/jira:jira` skill for Jira CLI reference, then search for children:

```bash
acli jira workitem search --jql '"Epic Link" = LOG-XXXX OR parent = LOG-XXXX' --json
```

Extract `customfield_10028` (story points) from each child. If more than 50 children, paginate.

#### 2b. Sum story points and convert to sprints

- Sum `customfield_10028` across all children (this total is in **days**)
- Count children with null/missing SP separately (for warning)
- Convert: `epic_sp = ceil(total_child_sp / 15)`

#### 2c. Set story points on the Epic

`acli` does not support custom fields. Use the Jira REST API directly:

```bash
curl -s -X PUT "https://redhat.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/LOG-XXXX" \
  -u "$JIRA_USER:$JIRA_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fields": {"customfield_10028": <epic_sp>}}'
```

### Step 3: Report to user

For each Epic, report one line:
- Epic key and summary
- Child count, total child SP (days), and epic SP (sprints)
- If any children lack SP: warn with count (e.g., "3 of 12 children unpointed")
- If epic SP > 5: warn that the Epic should be split

For bulk operations, also report a summary line at the end
(e.g., "Sized 8 Epics: total 24 sprints of work").
